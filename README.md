# ⏳ Time Tracker  

Sometimes we just want to **track our time while studying, working, or watching YouTube**. Sure, stopwatches exist — but they don’t add up total time for the **day or month**. On the other hand, most time-tracking websites focus on **timers** or overly complicated tools that aren’t built for quick and simple session tracking.  

That’s why I built this **Time Tracker Web App** — a clean, minimal, and powerful way to:  
- ⏱ Track sessions with a stopwatch-like system.  
- 📅 Review how much time you’ve spent in a day or month.  
- ✏️ Add custom sessions manually (for times you forgot to start the stopwatch).  
- 🗑 Delete sessions you don’t need.  
- 🔒 Lock past days to prevent accidental changes.  
- 🚫 Restrict future dates so they can’t be modified.  
- 💾 Store everything safely in your browser’s **Local Storage**.  
- 📤 Import/Export data to backup or move your history.  

This makes it a **practical study/productivity companion** that gives you full control without the mess.
